# @nora/modules

the component of .sys.mjs
the modules will be registered to `resource://noraneko/modules` namespace

This Component cannot be HMR because it registers module to command-line-handler esp. for PWA.

There seems a way to make compartiable with firefox-support but not currently.

Currently manual compile required.
